%Define a research and development agenda that will lead to robust and sustainable software.

%Discuss how the proposed software will fill a recognized need and advance research capability within a significant area or areas of science and engineering.

%Provide a clear description of how the proposed software compares to alternative or existing elements (including other commercial and research solutions) and what are the limitations of these existing elements. Proposals that could be supported by other programs at NSF or at other agencies should be submitted to those programs, and possibly related programs should be explicitly identified and reasoned as to why the proposal is not appropriate for those opportunities. Investigators are encouraged to contact the program with questions about appropriateness for this program prior to preparing a proposal.

%Provide an explicit description of the engineering process to be used for the design, development, and release of the software, its deployments and associated outreach to the end user community, its interoperability with widely used tools by the community, and an evaluation plan that involves end users.

%Include a project plan, including user interactions and a community-driven approach, and provide a timeline including a proof-of-concept demonstration of the key software components. The proposal must include a list of tangible metrics, with end user involvement, to be used to measure the success of the software element developed, especially the quantitative and qualitative definition of a "working prototype" against which that milestone will be judged, and the steps necessary to take the software element from prototype to dissemination into the community as reusable software resources.

%Provide a compelling discussion of the software's potential use by broader communities, preferably via use cases developed in concert with relevant domain scientists.

%Describe the extent to which issues of sustainability, manageability, usability, composability, and interoperability will be addressed and integrated into the proposed software system.

%Provide an explicit outreach and education plan to allow additional end user groups to take advantage of the proposed work. Describe a sustainability plan for the developed software beyond the lifetime of the award. Identify the open source license to be used.
